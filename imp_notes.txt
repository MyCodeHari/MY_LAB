[Build an Email Vaidation using String functions]

Points to be noted:
     -Only single @ sign in an individual email
     -No Uppercase alphabets in an individual email
     -only "underscroll" / "dot" are only special characters that are supposed to be allowed
     -no spaces are allowed in between an individual email
     -an individual email cannot start with a integer/digit

Use string functions:
     -isalpha()
     -isspace()
     -isdigit()
Methods:
     -.count()
     -.upper()
